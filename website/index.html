					<p>A strong grasp of language is one of the most important qualities any individual can possess, and reading a variety of literature is the best way to improve upon that. Unfortunately not everybody has consistent access to books, due to lack of libraries and/or internet access. However, something that almost everybody in the world has is an SMS-capable mobile device. Enter Alexandria.</p>
					<p>Alexandria is an SMS based service that delivers books - from a selection of 50,000 on the public domain - to anybody that requests it.</p>
					<p>Using Alexandria is super easy. Simply text the title of the book you want to read to Alexandria's number, and you will receive a page a day. If you want, you can request multiple pages in the same day. Let's get serious about language and literature.</p>
					<p>Text "hello" to +12267804047 for all the details.</p>
